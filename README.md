Overview

The BMI Calculator is a Swift app that helps users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). Users enter their weight in kilograms (kg) and height in centimeters (cm), and the app computes and displays their BMI. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height and is commonly used to assess one's health and fitness.

Features

Weight and Height Input: Users input their weight in kg and height in cm.

BMI Calculation: The app calculates BMI based on the user's input using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)), where height is converted from cm to meters.

BMI Display: The calculated BMI is displayed to the user.
